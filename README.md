# Installation:
First step would be to download a IDE(Visual Studio Code), Next step would be to install node.js(Type in the terminal "install node" ), Once node is successfully installed, The next step is to install a package.json file(Type in the terminal "npm init"), then you'd want to install the "inquirer" package for your prompts, lastly you'd want to make sure mySql work bench is installed for our database
&nbsp;

# Usage:

Once node and all your packages are installed, run the file in the command line(node tracker.js ), once the file is ran then you will be presented with prompts to either add new employess, roles or departments, view employees, roles, or departments and update employee roles.
